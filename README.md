# FashionHub - Item Management App

A full-stack application for managing fashion items, allowing users to view, add, and inquire about items. The application supports adding images (cover and additional images) for each item and stores item details like name, type, and description.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

cd fashionhub
Backend Setup
Install Backend Dependencies:

Navigate to the server directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
cd server
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the server directory with the following configuration:

env

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Run the Backend:

Run the following command to start the server:

npm start
The backend will be available at http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Install Frontend Dependencies:

Navigate to the client directory and install the required dependencies:


cd client
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the client directory and add the following:

env

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
Run the Frontend:

Run the following command to start the frontend:


npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Access the Application
Once both the frontend and backend are running, open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

How to Add New Items
Click on "Add Items" in the navigation bar.

Fill out the form with the item name, type, description, and upload cover image and additional images.

Click "Add Item" to submit the new item.

The new item will be added to the database and shown on the "View Items" page.

How to View Item Details
Click on any item in the "View Items" page to open a modal with detailed information.

You can view the item's images, description, and inquire via email.

CORS Policy
If you encounter a CORS error while trying to make requests from the frontend to the backend, follow the instructions below to configure the backend to accept cross-origin requests:

In the Backend (server.js):
Make sure you configure CORS middleware correctly:

javascript

const cors = require('cors');
const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'https://yourfrontendurl.com', // Replace with your frontend URL
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
Deployment
Deploying the Backend on Render
Go to Render and sign up/log in.

Create a new Web Service.

Link your GitHub repository.

Set build and start commands:

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: npm start

Set environment variables like MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, and Cloudinary API keys.

Deploying the Frontend on Vercel
Go to Vercel and sign up/log in.

Create a new project by linking your GitHub repository.

Vercel will automatically detect that it’s a React app and deploy it.

Set the REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable to your backend URL (https://fashion-hub-gtsw.onrender.com).
